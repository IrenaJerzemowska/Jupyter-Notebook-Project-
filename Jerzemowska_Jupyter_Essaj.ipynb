    "First book, which I would like to describe is considered to be one of the true classic in the genre of thriller. It is The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. In this book, the main character, a young student named Clarice Starling is asked to help with the investigation concerning crimes done by a murderer Buffalo Bill. In order to find any kind of evidence, Starling goes to a prison, in order to question another murderer  - doctor Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is a well - educated man, who earned a doctorate in psychiatry and (before being sentenced for his crimes) was considered to be one of the best in his field. His taste is quite sophisticated, due to the variety of expensive and exquisite dishes he cooks and his love for classical music and art. Besides that, he really enjoyed cooking, which included also cooking his victims. His cold blooded murders were the reason why he went to jail. However, his crimes, although scary, are not the topic of that essay. Hannibal’s language and the way he speaks resembles his character - his speech is sophisticated, usually includes vocabulary from foreign languages, especially French and Italian, and, generally speaking - it’s very posh;"

    "Patrick Bateman is a young and successful lawyer, who lives a perfect lifestyle. However, he has a dark secret - namely, a bunch of tapes in his wardrobe, and on each of those tapes are murders he commited. Every crime he commits is driven by his anger, especially one, when he kills his co-worker Paul Allen, only because of his jellousy. Patrick’s way of speaking (as well as Hannibal’) was masterly played by Christian Bale (the role of Hannibal was played by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and by Mads Mikkelsen in TV series titled Hannibal). Similarly to Lecter, Bateman’s taste is rather extravagant - he often wears luxorious and designer clothes, listens to music almost obessively and eats extravagant and gourmet dishes at quite expensive restaurants. In contrast to Hannibal, however, he speaks truly and candidly about how he feels and what happens to him, when he reaches his breakdown:"

In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I will put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, I simply am not there."
